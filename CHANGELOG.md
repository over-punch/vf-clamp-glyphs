# Changelog

## [1.2.22] — 2026-10-06

Naming now comes from one shared module, `vfclamp_naming.py`, synced from vf-clamp. The same file runs inside the npm package, so the Glyphs, RoboFont and npm outputs are identical (checked field by field with a parity harness). Changes:

- **Default output names give one range per axis**, in the font's own style words: selecting SemiCondensed and normal-width Thin–Light suggests "Encode Sans SemiCondensed-Normal Thin-Light" rather than "SemiCondensed Thin-Light".
- **A single-style pin** carries its style in the PostScript name (two pins of the same family no longer collide) and in nameID 17. A non-RIBBI pin (SemiBold) follows the OpenType "Arial Black" pattern: nameID 1 "Family SemiBold", nameID 2 "Regular", 16/17 written.
- **Slant-based italics** (`slnt` < 0) set ITALIC and OBLIQUE.
- **nameID 25** holds ASCII letters and digits only (OpenType spec), at most 27 characters; named-instance PostScript names use it, so long family names stay unique.
- **Family names in another script** give `Font-<hash>` PostScript names.
- **A blank output name is refused.**

## [1.2.21] — 2026-10-05

Fixes from a font-engineering review of vf-clamp (the same issues were fixed in `@overpunch/vf-clamp` 2.3.0):

- **STAT axis records are kept.** Clamping removed the STAT design-axis record of every pinned axis (Inter's `opsz` when pinned), which breaks upright/italic linking across files. Design-axis records are now never removed; pinned axes keep the axis values at the pin.
- **Linked STAT values keep their names.** A Format 3 value whose link pointed outside the new range was deleted, taking the style's STAT name with it. It now becomes a Format 1 value (same name, no link).
- **Names on every platform.** Unicode-platform (0) name records were left with the retail names; they're now rewritten with the Windows ones. nameID 3 (unique ID) is rewritten to `version;PostScriptName;family` so the file never shares the source's ID. Named instances' PostScript names now follow the new prefix instead of the retail one.
- **RIBBI-correct style.** BOLD is set from weight 700, not 600, so a SemiBold default is no longer flagged Bold. A separate italic VF (no `ital`/`slnt` axis) keeps its ITALIC bit and is named Italic; nameID 2 always agrees with OS/2.
- **Safe PostScript names.** Accented names are transliterated (Été → Ete), names in other scripts get `Font-<hash>`, and names over 63 characters end in a hash so two long names never collide.
- **avar 2 and VARC fonts are refused** where the installed fontTools can't restrict them correctly.
- Adds `tests/test_review_fixes.py` (8 tests against the Inter fixture).

## [1.2.20] — 2026-06-22

Two upstream issue fixes plus a README addition:

- **Plugin data moved out of Glyphs' Plugins folder** (issue #84, reported by @florianpircher). Presets and the recent-folders MRU previously lived in `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Plugins/vf-clamp/`, but that folder is reserved by Glyphs for plugin bundles only. They now live in the vendor-namespaced `~/Library/Application Support/studio.liiift.vf-clamp/`. `presets.migrate_legacy_support_dir()` runs once on first launch to move any existing `presets.json` / `recent.json` to the new location (best-effort, idempotent, never overwrites newer data, leaves legacy files in place for downgrades).
- **Corrected install instructions** (issue #83, reported by @schriftgestalt). Double-clicking the unsigned `.glyphsPlugin` in Finder is blocked by macOS Gatekeeper and never loads. The README and CLAUDE.md now tell users to drag the bundle onto the Glyphs app icon, which lets Glyphs install it and sidesteps Gatekeeper. The quarantine-clearing note is kept as a fallback for anyone who already tried double-clicking.
- **Added a "Try it live" section** to the README linking the [vfclamp.com](https://vfclamp.com) web demo of the same clamping engine.

## [1.2.19] — 2026-06-14

- **Chart pushed down 16 px** (`plot_y_box` 60 → 76) so the y_max corner label drawn at `plot_y_internal − 12` inside the chart's view has visible breathing room above the chart border instead of cramping against the preview-name text directly above it. User screenshot on Daith Adv showed the "96" label sitting almost flush against the preview name line.

## [1.2.18] — 2026-06-13

Three layout fixes from a user screenshot review:

- **Hull plot corner labels moved OUTSIDE the chart border** so they no longer overlap instance dots near the axis extremes (the Daith Adv screenshot showed "100,8" colliding with the bottom-left dot and the right-edge label colliding with the bottom-right dot). y_max sits above the chart in PLOT_PAD; x_min/y_min and x_max sit below the border on their own row. The redundant "full:" subtext is gone since corner labels now convey the axis bounds.
- **Size estimate line shifted right by 16 px** so its left edge aligns with the chart's internal "wght: lo–hi" text rather than the chart's view bounds. Fixes the visible misalignment between the two adjacent labels.
- **LOG pane gets text-container insets** (8 × 4 px) so log content has visible left + top padding instead of sitting flush against the dialog edge.

Also: bundle now includes `versions/dialog-v1.2.18.png` showing the dialog after all three fixes, with the same Daith Adv selection the user screenshotted.

## [1.2.17] — 2026-06-13

User feedback after the v1.2.16 designer signoff: the two-up static specimen made the animated probe ring on the design-space plot feel disconnected (nothing was moving for it to track). Three changes restore the visual link and add a long-requested file-size signal:

- **Single animated specimen restored** (replaces the v1.2.13 two-up lightest/heaviest layout). "HOHO Anes" sweeps through the licensed design space at 48 pt with a live caption showing the current `wght X · opsz Y`. The probe ring's path now reads naturally because the specimen visibly moves along the same path.
- **Probe ring simplified to white fill at 25 % alpha** — single solid translucent dot, no two-pass halo + bright stroke. Reads as a soft tracker rather than a heavy badge on top of the chart.
- **Master + axis counters in the size-estimate line**: now reads `~38 KB · 5 instances · 5 masters · 2 ax · 1 pinned` instead of just `~38 KB · 5 instances`. New `_count_structural` helper iterates the GSFont masters and counts those whose coordinates fall inside the hull range on every axis, plus reports total axes and pinned axes. Helps users understand what's actually driving the file size before they generate.
- Specimen size restored 32 → 48 pt now that the preview is a single specimen again (the 32 pt two-up cap is gone).

## [1.2.16] — 2026-06-13

- **User-facing terminology rename**: "hull" → "design space" / "axis ranges" in everything a user actually reads (VoiceOver labels, accessibility values, error messages, the chips-fallback label). Code-internal `hull`, `_hull`, `compute_hull`, `setHull_` etc. stay — they're correctly typed and the refactor cost is high — but the strings a font engineer actually encounters now use the terminology the type-design community already knows.
- **Per-build snapshot versioning**: `versions/dialog-v$VERSION.png` now ships alongside every release zip. `scripts/build-zip.sh` runs the render harness as its last step (best-effort, skipped silently when PyObjC is missing) so each shipped version has a visual artifact paired with its commit.
- Test suite green at 99/99 (algorithm-correctness tests in `tests/` — `core.py` + `gsfont_core.py` paths).

## [1.2.15] — 2026-06-13

Five remaining-polish items the second designer review flagged, all landed in one pass:

- **Log pane unread indicator** — a 3-px accent stripe pinned to the left edge of the LOG flashes for ~0.8 seconds (NSTimer-driven fade at 30 fps) every time `_log_append` adds a line. Implemented as new `_LogActivityStripe` NSView subclass. Addresses Interaction Designer's "log lacks read/unread affordance" finding.
- **Shortcut hint text expanded** to include keyboard navigation: `⌘A All   ⌘D None   ⌘I Invert   ⇥ Navigate   ␣ Toggle   ⏎ Generate`. Spinner widget pushed right (PAD+550) to clear the wider hint string. Accessibility Engineer flagged keyboard discovery as undocumented.
- **Defensive long-tag wrapping** in the hull plot labels: measures the combined "{tag_x}: lo–hi  {tag_y}: lo–hi" width before drawing and falls back to a stacked two-line layout when it would overflow the chart. Handles GRAD, XTRA, MONO and similar 4-letter axis tags without word-wrap or truncation.
- **Keyboard focus ring on HullPlotView**: `acceptsFirstResponder` returns True; `becomeFirstResponder`/`resignFirstResponder` trigger redraws; a 2-pt control-accent rounded rectangle paints around the chart when the view holds focus.
- **Per-dot accessibility children**: new `_HullDotAccessibilityElement` (NSAccessibilityElement subclass) per instance with role=AXButton, dynamic label ("Instance N: wght X, opsz Y, selected/unselected"), an accessibilityFrame computed from the last drawn dot position, and an accessibilityPerformPress that toggles selection via the same callback path as a mouse click. HullPlotView's `accessibilityChildren` returns the full list (cached, invalidated on roster change). VoiceOver users can now navigate dot-by-dot and toggle selections, fully matching mouse behaviour.

## [1.2.14] — 2026-06-13

Six refinements landed in one cycle from the second multi-designer review against v1.2.13:

- **Hull plot pulled back from 175 → 150 px** to restore Zone 2 vertical balance — the previous bump starved the specimen area. Plot still reads cleanly for 4-row fonts.
- **Specimen-to-Zone3 gap restored from 10 → 16 px** so the dialog's vertical rhythm matches PAD throughout (Visual Designer flagged the one-off 10 px as a baseline break).
- **Tick marks bright** — bumped from `secondaryLabelColor` 1.0 pt → `labelColor` 1.5 pt. Corner labels (`100,8`, `900`, `72`) likewise bumped to `labelColor` (Info + Accessibility agreed).
- **Unselected dot radius 2.5 → 3.5** so the dots stay clearly visible against the dark Glyphs panel (Accessibility WCAG concern). 5-vs-3.5 selected/unselected ratio still reads as a decisive hierarchy.
- **Two-up specimen — lightest renders at 75 % of heavy size** so the weight differential is visible at a glance (UX Designer's call). Specimen captions bumped from `secondaryLabelColor` → `labelColor`.
- **Probe ring shrunk 7.5 → 6.5** so it doesn't visually merge with a 5-px selected dot at the same position.
- **Accessibility annotations** on `HullPlotView` + `AnimatedPreviewView`: static `setAccessibilityLabel_`, `setAccessibilityRoleDescription_`, `setAccessibilityHelp_` plus dynamic `accessibilityValue()` overrides that report current hull ranges, instance count, and the lightest/heaviest variation values. VoiceOver users can now navigate to and understand both views.

## [1.2.13] — 2026-06-13

Three previously-held-off design changes implemented in the same iteration cycle (harness-driven, no Glyphs restarts):

- **Two-up specimen** replaces the animated 60→54 pt single specimen with a static side-by-side rendering of the hull's lightest (left) and heaviest (right) extremes at 32 pt. Each side captioned with its variation values (e.g. `wght 190  ·  opsz 12`). The Type Designer's recommendation: the specimen should prove the *range* of licensed instances, not animate through the middle.
- **Axis tick marks + corner labels** on the hull plot. Ticks at min/mid/max on each axis (extending outward from the chart border) plus numeric corner labels INSIDE the chart (`100,8` bottom-left, `900` bottom-right, `72` top-left). The Information Designer's critical finding: the chart had no numeric scale ON it.
- **Live-toggle highlight ring**: when a checkbox or dot is toggled, an expanding white ring fades around the corresponding instance dot for ~400 ms. Driven by an NSTimer that ticks at 30 fps and invalidates itself when the animation finishes. The dialog's `_toggle_instance_at_index` and `_on_list_edit` both fire `setRecentlyToggled_(idx)` so click and checkbox paths share one feedback channel.

## [1.2.12] — 2026-06-13

Four refinements driven by a 5-designer review panel (type designer, information designer, interaction designer, visual designer, accessibility engineer) all reviewing snapshots from the new `tools/render_dialog.py` full-dialog mock harness:

- **Hull plot grew from 140 → 175 px tall** so the 4 dot rows of a typical 4-opsz/9-weight font fit with breathing room and the axis labels below get a real gap. The plot-to-specimen gap tightens from 32 → 22 to absorb the change without resizing the window.
- **Specimen size tuned from 60 → 54 pt** to match the slightly tighter preview region underneath the larger plot. Still visually dominant but no longer crowding its caption.
- **Selected vs unselected dot hierarchy strengthened**: selected dots grew from radius 4 → 5 while unselected dropped from 3 → 2.5. The split now reads as a real hierarchy instead of two same-size dots in different colours. `DOT_INSET` bumped from 6 → 8 to keep the larger dots inside the chart border.
- **Action bar shortcut chips ("⌘A All", "⌘D None", "⌘I Invert", "⏎ Generate")** swapped from `tertiaryLabelColor` → `secondaryLabelColor` so they're legible against the dark Glyphs panel instead of effectively invisible.
- **Instance list values now align in a monospaced column**: names are left-justified to the widest name in the font and a monospaced font is installed on the display column, so a scan down the wght/opsz values lands on a consistent x-coordinate row to row.

## [1.2.11] — 2026-06-13

Four dialog-rendering refinements found via the new `tools/render_preview.py` harness:

- **Hull fill softened from 0.55 → 0.30 alpha** so per-instance dots inside the hull rectangle stay legible instead of being washed out by the accent colour.
- **Unselected dots use secondaryLabelColor instead of tertiaryLabelColor**. The tertiary tier was disappearing into the dark Glyphs panel; the bump still keeps unselected dots clearly subordinate to the filled selected ones.
- **Probe ring rendered as a two-pass halo + bright stroke** (3.5 px dark halo, 2 px label stroke, radius 7.5) so it stays visible whether it's over the translucent hull fill, sitting on a selected dot, or floating in empty design space.
- **Axis labels read "wght: pinned 253"** instead of the awkward "wght: 253–253" when a selection collapses an axis to a single value.

## [1.2.10] — 2026-06-13

- **Hull plot dots no longer clip at the edges**: the 2-axis plot now maps instance coordinates into a 6-px inset rectangle so a dot at the axis minimum/maximum sits fully inside the chart border instead of straddling it. New `DOT_INSET` constant in `hull_plot.py`.
- **Animation probe ring**: while the HOHO Anes specimen animates, a small hollow circle now tracks the live position inside the hull rectangle so you can see which point of the licensed design space the specimen is currently rendering at. Wired by `AnimatedPreviewView.setProbeTarget_(hullView)`; each `tick_` pushes `_current_variations()` into `HullPlotView.setProbeCoords_`. The ring clears automatically when animation stops.
- **HOHO Anes specimen bumped from 44 pt to 60 pt** so it fills more of the right column. The old 44 pt was a defensive overcorrection after a 64-pt overflow on a very-bold-axis font; 60 pt is the comfortable middle ground.
- **Hull plot now shows the full font axis range** in a muted second line below the selection range — `full: wght 100–900  opsz 12–42` — so the hull rectangle reads in context of the design space, not in isolation.

## [1.2.9] — 2026-06-13

- **Removed the redundant single-line status label** at the bottom of the action bar. The LOG pane already shows everything that used to appear there; every save was producing a duplicate "Saved: …" line below the buttons. `_set_status()` now writes only to the log.
- **Interactive hull plot**: clicking instance dots in the 2-axis plot toggles their selection. Each instance is drawn as a small dot at its design-space coordinates — filled accent for selected rows, outlined for unselected. New `HullPlotView.setInstances_selectedIndices_onClick_(...)` accepts the per-instance coords, the current selection mask, and a Python callback. `mouseDown_` does an 8-px-radius hit test against the most-recent draw to decide which instance to toggle, then invokes the callback. New helpers `_selected_instance_indices()` and `_toggle_instance_at_index()` in the dialog handle the round trip.
- 1-axis plot and 3+-axis chips view stay non-interactive for now — they're trivial enough that the instance list checkboxes are still the right surface.

## [1.2.8] — 2026-06-13

- **Fix: "The file 'clone (Autosaved).glyphs' doesn't exist." alert after every save**. `gsfont.copy()` (the first step of `clamp_gsfont`) silently registers the clone with Glyphs' shared `NSDocumentController` and gives it an autosave path that is never actually written. When the cloned GSFont was later garbage-collected, Glyphs' autosave subsystem looked for that phantom file and surfaced a modal alert. New helper `_evict_clone_tracking(gsfont)` in `gsfont_core.py` calls `parent.updateChangeCount_(0)` → `NSDocumentController.removeDocument_(parent)` → `parent.close()` to make Glyphs forget the clone before the autosave check fires. Wired into `save_gsfont_to_glyphs`, `export_gsfont_binary_via_glyphs`, and the preview-compile temp-doc cleanup in `font_registration.py`.

## [1.2.7] — 2026-06-13

- **Fix bottom-up Y inversion for raw NSView placement**. The hull-plot and HOHO-Anes preview views are mounted directly on `win._window.contentView().addSubview_()` — which uses macOS-default bottom-left coordinates — but everywhere else in the dialog we use vanilla's top-left convention. The two NSViews were therefore rendering at flipped Y positions. Symptoms: in v1.2.6's taller window, the hull plot rectangle drifted down into Zone 3 (overlapping Format/Folder), and "HOHO Anes" floated up into the preview-name slot. Fix: convert top-y → bottom-y (`window_h − top_y − view_h`) before constructing each raw NSView's frame.
- **Shrink HOHO Anes from 64 pt to 44 pt** so the specimen fits comfortably inside the ~370 px right column even when the wght/wdth sweep makes the text temporarily wider on heavy axis values.

## [1.2.6] — 2026-06-13

- **"Open after generating" checkbox** in the Output zone. When ticked, successful saves trigger `Glyphs.open(path)` for `.glyphs` outputs and `NSWorkspace.openFile_` for binary outputs.
- **Dedicated scrollable LOG pane** between the Output zone and the action bar. Replaces the previously-truncated 74-px status sliver. NSTextView wrapped in an NSScrollView, monospaced, semi-transparent dark background. All status updates flow through `_log_append()` which auto-scrolls to the bottom and trims to ~5 KB so a long session doesn't bloat the editor.
- Status label retained for the brief one-line summary in the action bar; the log is now the authoritative surface for anything longer.
- Action area shape: Zone 3 height bumped 144 → 174 to fit the new checkbox row; new constant `LOG_H = 84` reserves the log pane; total window height grows by ~94 px.

## [1.2.5] — 2026-06-13

- **Real fix for invisible wght animation**: `CTFontManagerCreateFontDescriptorsFromURL` returns one descriptor per font face in the file — for a variable font with named instances, that's the variable font itself **plus** one descriptor per named instance with axes already collapsed. v1.2.3 / v1.2.4 took `descriptors[0]` blindly, which often landed on an instance descriptor with no variable axes left to animate. v1.2.5 walks every descriptor, probes each with `CTFontCreateWithFontDescriptor`, queries `CTFontCopyVariationAxes`, and returns the first one that exposes a non-empty axis list (falls back to `descriptors[0]` for legitimately static fonts).
- **Readable error messages**: status label was only ~74 px wide so any error longer than "Error: …" got clipped. Moved to a full-width row above the bottom edge. Long error tooltips now also attach for hover. Full Python traceback is unconditionally logged to stderr so the Glyphs Macro Panel always carries the complete error, even when the status label truncates.
- **Action bar height** bumped 56 → 64 to fit the new status row without re-clipping the buttons.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-06-13

- **Fix: axis animation now visible for source fonts with non-standard axis identifiers**. v1.2.3 computed identifiers from OpenType tags (`'wght' → 0x77676874`) but the compiled font may report different identifiers in its `fvar` table. Now `setFontDescriptor_` queries the real axes via `CTFontCopyVariationAxes` and builds a `tag → identifier` map so `NSFontVariationAttribute` receives the keys the font actually understands. Falls back to the computed identifier when the CoreText query fails.
- **Hide the specimen at 10% opacity when no instances are selected**. Previously "HOHO Anes" stayed at full opacity with stale variation values even when the hull was empty — visually loud but conveying nothing. Now the no-selection state dims to 10% with a hint caption.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-06-13

- **Real source-font preview**: the animated `HOHO Anes` specimen now renders with the user's actual font instead of the macOS system fallback. New module `font_registration.py` wraps `CTFontManagerRegisterFontsForURL` to register the source with the process-scope font namespace and extract its `NSFontDescriptor`, which `AnimatedPreviewView.setFontDescriptor_()` consumes.
- **File source mode**: synchronous register on `_load_font(path)`. Effectively instant.
- **Open Font source mode**: spawns a background worker (`export_gsfont_to_temp_vf_async`) that saves a copy of the open `.glyphs` to a temp directory, opens it headlessly via `Glyphs.open(showInterface=False)`, finds-or-creates a Variable Font Setting, calls `vf_inst.generate(format='OTF', containers=[PLAIN])` to compile a temp variable TTF, and registers it. Slow first hit (a few seconds) but only once per source font. Stale-callback token guards against the user changing sources mid-export.
- **Cleanup**: `_on_cancel` invokes `cleanup_all_temp_paths()` to unregister every temp font + delete every temp directory so registered fonts don't leak across sessions.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-06-13

- **Fix**: Cancel + Generate buttons no longer clipped by the bottom edge of the dialog. The 36-px action bar was too tight for a 32-px Generate, 24-px Cancel/Reveal, and 18-px shortcut hints — bumped to 56 px with hints anchored to a stable Y offset.
- **New**: Animated `HOHO Anes` specimen preview in the dashboard zone. Renders the specimen text and cycles `font-variation-settings` over the **selected hull range** (not the full source axis range) so what you see matches what a licensed customer would see in the clamped output. Each axis sweeps lo → hi → lo over a 2.4-second cosine loop, phase-offset per axis so multi-axis fonts don't move in lockstep. Live caption beneath the specimen shows the current axis values.
- v1.2.2 uses the system variable font for animation (proves the pipeline + axis math). v1.2.3 will register the actual source font via `CTFontManagerRegisterFontsForURL` so the preview shows real glyph shapes from the user's font.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-13

- **Fix critical layout bug in v1.2.0**: zone-build methods used box-relative coordinates while widgets were attached to the window root, causing every widget in zones 1/2/3 to render stacked at the top-left of the window with massive overlap. Cause: `vanilla.Box` re-parenting via `box.attr = win.widget` is unreliable across Glyphs builds; widgets stay attached to whatever container they were originally assigned to. Fix: keep the Boxes as decorative frames only, place every child widget at window-relative coordinates (add `PAD` to X, add `y` to Y), drop the broken `box.title = win.title` re-assignments, and mount the hull plot NSView on `win._window.contentView()` instead of `box._nsObject`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-12

Major UX release. The dialog is restructured into a clear three-zone
layout (Source / Instances + Hull / Output) with a new instance list,
a graphical hull preview, persistent presets, recent-folders MRU, and
drag-and-drop font loading. Build-zip and version-parity tooling were
tightened in lockstep.

### Added

- **Three-zone dialog restructure.** The window is reorganised into
  Source, Instances + Hull preview, and Output zones with consistent
  spacing, semibold zone headers, and accessibility roles so screen
  readers announce the new grouping correctly.
- **`vanilla.List`-based instance picker.** Replaces the stack of
  individual `CheckBox` widgets. The list supports multi-select,
  keyboard navigation, type-ahead, and a `Cmd-A` / `Cmd-Shift-A`
  select-all / deselect-all binding. Scroll height no longer needs to
  be pre-reserved because the `List` is its own NSScrollView.
- **Graphical hull plot (`hull_plot.py`).** New custom `NSView`
  renders a 1-axis bar or 2-axis rectangle showing the full design
  space vs. the selected sub-hull. Three-or-more-axis fonts fall back
  to the existing chip preview. The view degrades gracefully when
  AppKit is unavailable so the module is safe to import on CI.
- **Presets (`presets.py`).** Save a named selection (instances +
  output format + name pattern) and recall it from a popup. Atomic
  JSON persistence under
  `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Plugins/vf-clamp/presets.json`
  with schema validation and graceful corruption handling.
- **Recent-folders MRU.** The output-folder popup remembers the last
  5 folders used, persisted alongside presets in `recent.json`. The
  list is capped at `RECENT_FOLDERS_MAX = 5` to match Finder's
  "Recent Places" density.
- **Drag-and-drop font loading.** The Source zone accepts dropped
  `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, `.woff2` files via `NSPasteboardTypeFileURL`
  / `NSFilenamesPboardType`. The drop target is the entire Source
  zone, with a highlight ring during the drag.
- **Format descriptions.** Each format in the popup now has a one-line
  description beside it (e.g. "WOFF2 compressed web font (requires
  brotli)") so the trade-off is visible before clicking Generate.
- **Cmd-key shortcuts.** `Cmd-A` selects all instances, `Cmd-Shift-A`
  deselects all, `Cmd-S` saves a preset, `Cmd-,` opens the preset
  popup. Implemented via a local `NSEventMaskKeyDown` monitor.

### Changed

- **Plugin shell rewritten** to host the new three-zone layout while
  keeping the existing `LiiiftVFClampPlugin` GeneralPlugin contract,
  the file-source worker thread, and the GSFont main-thread path
  untouched. Approximately 1.3k of the 2.0k-line `plugin.py` diff is
  layout / wiring; the underlying `core.py`, `gsfont_core.py`, and
  `formats.py` modules are unchanged.
- **Axis colour palette factored** into `_rgb_for_axis` so both the
  chip preview and the new hull plot share a single source of truth
  for light/dark appearance handling.
- **Status label promoted** to the Output zone footer with a clearer
  separation between the error styling and the Reveal-in-Finder
  affordance.

### Fixed

- Validation harness for headless smoke tests now uses an
  attribute-tolerant `StubModule` subclass so `from AppKit import ...`
  and `from GlyphsApp import ...` succeed under bare `python3 -c`
  invocations without needing the real Glyphs runtime. No production
  code change — the plugin's imports are correct.

## [1.1.5] — 2026-06-12

- Fix: Instance checkboxes correctly rendered but **overlapped** the Hull / Output Name / Format / Folder rows below them. Cause: scroll widget grew downward at populate time while the rows below stayed at their original Y positions (vanilla widgets with positive Y don't auto-reflow). Fix: reserve the maximum scroll height (`MAX_VISIBLE_INSTANCES = 8` rows × 24px) at build time so every widget below sits at a fixed Y regardless of how many instances the font has. Trade-off: a font with 1-2 instances now shows some empty scroll space, but nothing overlaps and the window doesn't jump on font load.

## [1.1.4] — 2026-06-12

- Fix: Format popup defaulted to `TTF` when launching with an open Glyphs document instead of `.glyphs` — the cross-mode "preserve user's selection" logic kept the file-mode default alive. Now always resets to the per-mode default on source mode change.
- Fix: Instance checkboxes were invisible inside the scroll area despite the font's instance count rendering correctly. Root cause: scroll widget moved from `CONTROL_X` to `PAD` during populate, leaving the inner_group's frame misaligned with the new clip view. Populate now resizes the scroll widget first (keeping it at `CONTROL_X` to match the build layout) before swapping the document view, explicitly sets the inner_group's frame, and calls `tile() + reflectScrolledClipView_()` so NSScrollView recomputes its scroll range.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.3] — 2026-06-12

Final pass on the panel review backlog — closes the last 5 deferred findings
from the 1.1.2 follow-up cycle.

### Added

- Public naming aliases on `core.py` so call-sites can use the documented
  identifiers (closes deferred naming-alias finding).
- Type hints on the new `gsfont_core.py` / `formats.py` module surfaces so
  downstream consumers (and `mypy`) see a consistent signature across the
  fontTools and GSFont paths (closes deferred typing finding).
- Explicit `setAccessibilityLabel_` on the remaining controls in the dialog
  that were missed in the 1.1.1 a11y sweep (closes deferred a11y finding).
- `pathlib` adoption on the new GSFont path for consistency with the rest of
  `core.py` (partial — file-source path remains on `os.path` because
  `fontTools.ttLib.TTFont` takes raw paths) (closes deferred pathlib finding).

### Changed

- Sheet vs. window rationale captured in the dialog source so future
  contributors understand why generate-progress lives in a sheet rather than
  the main window (closes deferred Sheet-rationale finding).

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-11

Follow-up release addressing the 20 deferred findings from the 1.1.1 panel
review — architectural separation, font correctness on edge cases, and
controller-panel UX items deferred from the initial fix pass.

### Added

- `formats.py` module — central registry of output formats so dispatch logic
  lives in one file instead of being threaded through `core.py` and `plugin.py`.
- `gsfont_core.py` module — extracted GSFont (Glyphs.app source) helpers from
  `core.py` into their own subsystem so the fontTools binary path and the
  Glyphs-app object path are no longer entangled.
- `tests/test_coverage_gaps.py` — 380 lines of additional tests covering
  previously-untested branches in `core.py`, `plugin.py`, and the new
  `gsfont_core.py` / `formats.py` modules.

### Changed

- `core.py` refactored to delegate GSFont-specific work to `gsfont_core.py`
  and format-specific work to `formats.py`; module shrinks accordingly.
- `plugin.py` reorganised around the new module split for clearer flow.
- `scripts/build-zip.sh` updated to bundle the new modules and exclude
  pre-built `vf-clamp-glyphs.zip` / `.sha256` from the source tree.

### Fixed

- 20 deferred findings from the 1.1.1 panel review covering architectural
  separation, font correctness on edge cases (round-trip / collapsed axes),
  and UX improvements in the controller panel.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-11

This release lands the targeted fixes from a 10-engineer panel review of the
1.1.0 GSFont source path. 50 findings were filed as GitHub issues #33–#82;
this release closes the CRITICAL packaging/version-sync/correctness items and
the highest-impact MAJOR UX/security items.

### Added

- `is_fonttools_ready`, `fonttools_import_error`, `is_glyphs_app_available`,
  `open_font_safely` public helpers in `core.py` so `plugin.py` no longer
  reaches into `_FONTTOOLS_*` / `_GLYPHS_AVAILABLE` underscore internals
  (closes #45).
- `FontParseError` (subclass of `ValueError`) so callers can distinguish
  parse failure from I/O failure on `_safe_open_font` (closes #47, #78).
- `_PIN_EPSILON` tolerance on `clamp_gsfont` so a single-instance pin can
  succeed against a master whose coordinates round-tripped through floating
  point; tailored error message when the pin point coincides with no
  master (closes #75).
- `_disambiguated_instance_labels` helper shared by
  `get_axis_hull_from_instances` and `filter_fvar_instances` so duplicate
  subfamily names match correctly (closes #71).
- `tests/test_gsfont_helpers.py` with a `FakeGSFont` factory exercising
  `list_open_glyphs_fonts`, `gsfont_label`, `gsfont_instance_names`,
  `compute_gsfont_hull`, `clamp_gsfont` (deep-copy, VF-setting preservation,
  family rewrite, empty selection, no-masters), `_container_for_format`,
  and `_outline_format_for`. Test count: 66 → 75 (closes #37, #77).
- CI now uploads coverage and runs `build-zip.sh` as a preflight smoke check
  (closes #53).

### Changed

- `clamp_gsfont` deep-clones the source GSFont via save-to-temp-and-reopen
  (with `copy.deepcopy` fallback in CI) so mutations never leak back into
  the user's open document (closes #40).
- VF Setting instances now get their `axes` trimmed when an axis collapses,
  keeping `font.axes` structurally parallel to `instance.axes`
  (closes #39).
- `save_gsfont_to_glyphs` default `format_version` now inherits the source
  font's `formatVersion` instead of hardcoding `3` (closes #76).
- `safe_output_path` uses `os.path.realpath` so macOS symlink mismatches
  (`/var` → `/private/var`) cannot smuggle a traversal past `commonpath`
  (closes #48).
- `_generate_from_gsfont` defers the heavy clamp + `Glyphs.open` work via
  `AppHelper.callAfter` so the spinner and status label paint before the
  main thread blocks (closes #38).
- `_on_cancel` signals a cancellation flag to in-flight file-source
  workers; the worker skips its success callback and unlinks any partial
  output (closes #43).
- `_auto_select_frontmost_gsfont` uses `is` for identity comparison
  (GSFont `__eq__` is NSObject `-isEqual:` pointer identity; PyObjC can
  reissue wrappers) (closes #70).
- `showDialog_` surfaces an existing dialog instead of spawning a zombie
  one (closes #68).
- `axisPreview` cell now wraps lines so the multi-line attributed string
  renders correctly instead of being clipped (closes #67).
- WOFF2 brotli-availability check now runs for the GSFont source path too
  (closes #57).
- All/None/Invert bulk-select buttons get explicit
  `setAccessibilityLabel_` (closes #82).
- `Glyphs.open` `showInterface=False` `TypeError` fallback no longer opens
  a visible window and steals focus (closes #50).
- `vf_inst.generate()` return value handling now treats non-True success
  values explicitly (closes #51).
- `produce_restricted_vf` and `export_gsfont_binary` unlink partial output
  on failure (closes #54).
- Plugin menu registration no longer mixes `self.menuName` with manual
  `NSMenuItem` injection (closes #69).
- `_on_generate_failure` no longer double-prefixes `Error:`; raw paths are
  scrubbed to `~`-relative form; error-state styling applied to status
  label (closes #55).
- Reveal button is disabled + hidden on a subsequent generate failure so
  it cannot surface a stale prior output (closes #56).
- Temp-directory cleanup is now structured try/finally and leaked Glyphs
  documents are closed from `Glyphs.fonts` (closes #49).
- Broad `except Exception` blocks narrowed across `core.py` and `plugin.py`
  so real errors propagate instead of being swallowed (closes #78).

### Fixed

- Self-referential `vf-clamp.glyphsPlugin/vf-clamp.glyphsPlugin` symlink
  removed; `build-zip.sh` aborts if one reappears (closes #33).
- `Contents/Resources/__pycache__` stripped from the shipped bundle;
  `build-zip.sh` strips `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.swp`, `*~`
  and uses `--symlinks` to prevent regression (closes #34).
- `Info.plist`, `pyproject.toml`, and `CHANGELOG.md` versions are now
  asserted to agree in the build preflight; ships refuse to proceed
  otherwise (closes #35).
- README rewritten to cover both source paths; the "important: file-only"
  callout that contradicted 1.1.0 was removed (closes #36).
- Stale "47 tests" and "framework-agnostic core.py" claims corrected in
  README + Development section (closes #77).
- `_safe_open_font` size check no longer TOCTOU-races the open; raises
  `FontParseError` (subclass of `ValueError`) on parse failure to give
  the right exception taxonomy (closes #47).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-11

This release introduces a second source mode: clamping the open Glyphs.app
document directly to a new `.glyphs` file (or a Glyphs-native binary export),
in addition to the existing exported-font-file workflow.

### Added

- Open-Glyphs-font source path: `clamp_gsfont`, `save_gsfont_to_glyphs`,
  `export_gsfont_binary_via_glyphs`, `list_open_glyphs_fonts`, `gsfont_label`,
  `gsfont_instance_names`, `compute_gsfont_hull` in `core.py`.
- Optional `from GlyphsApp import ...` import block in `core.py` so the new
  helpers only resolve inside Glyphs (no-op in CI).
- Source radio (`Open Font` / `File`) in the dialog; the dialog now defaults
  to the frontmost open Glyphs document when one is available.
- `.glyphs` output format for the open-font source path.
- Hull-preview chips with per-axis color coding.
- Primary blue Generate button (Return key equivalent) and Escape-bound
  Cancel button in the bottom action bar.
- Build-script preflight that asserts `Info.plist` version, `pyproject.toml`
  version, and CHANGELOG header are in sync, and refuses to ship a zip with
  a self-referential symlink or > 50 entries.
- `[build-system]` and `[tool.mypy]` tables in `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed

- `build-zip.sh` now strips `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, editor swap
  files; uses `zip --symlinks` so symlinks are preserved instead of followed;
  verifies the resulting zip size and entry count.
- README documents the open-font path (Source radio, `.glyphs` output,
  required Glyphs 3.2+ APIs) and the new failure modes.

### Fixed

- Removed the self-referential `vf-clamp.glyphsPlugin/vf-clamp.glyphsPlugin`
  symlink that caused `zip -r` to recurse and produce a 2.9 MB bundle
  containing the bundle inside itself dozens of times.
- Removed the developer-machine `Contents/Resources/__pycache__/` directory
  from the shipped bundle; `.pyc` are regenerated by Glyphs on first import.
- `_on_generate_failure` no longer double-prefixes `Error:` when relaying a
  message through `_set_status(error=True)`.
- Reveal button is hidden + disabled on a subsequent generate failure so it
  cannot surface a stale prior output.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-01

This release is the result of a panel review covering correctness, security,
packaging, and developer experience. See repo issues labelled `review` for the
underlying findings.

### Added

- `core.py` extracted from `plugin.py` so all fonttools logic is unit-testable
  outside Glyphs.app.
- Pytest test suite (`tests/`) with an in-memory variable-font fixture
  (47 tests covering compact_name, compute_default_output_name, sanitisers,
  compute_hull, produce_restricted_vf, fvar/STAT filtering, WOFF/WOFF2 output).
- GitHub Actions CI matrix (Python 3.9–3.12) running on push/PR.
- `pyproject.toml` with pinned `fonttools >= 4.34` requirement.
- `scripts/build-zip.sh` reproducible build script + `.sha256` checksum for the
  distributable.
- Axis-range preview line in the dialog showing the computed hull per axis.
- Bulk-select buttons (All / None / Invert) above the instance list.
- Reveal-in-Finder button next to the status after a successful generate.
- Progress spinner during background generation.
- LICENSE shipped inside the bundle's `Resources/` so it travels with installs.

### Changed

- `Info.plist` now includes `CFBundleShortVersionString` (semver),
  `CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion`, `CFBundleDevelopmentRegion`,
  `LSMinimumSystemVersion`, `NSHumanReadableCopyright`, and the
  `GlyphsRequiresAppVersion` key so Glyphs 2 fails cleanly.
- Reverse-DNS identifier switched to `studio.liiift.vfclamp`.
- `NSPrincipalClass` renamed to vendor-namespaced `LiiiftVFClampPlugin`
  (with a `VFClampPlugin = LiiiftVFClampPlugin` alias for back-compat).
- Menu registration now uses `Glyphs.menu[SCRIPT_MENU].submenu().addItem_()`
  and an ObjC selector string instead of a bound Python method.
- Menu action target now uses `setAction_('showDialog:')` rather than passing a
  bound method.
- `setMenuName` is set on the plugin so the submenu label is not derived from
  the bundle slug.
- Worker-thread main-thread callbacks now use `AppHelper.callAfter` instead of
  the non-existent `objc.callOnMainThread`, with a dialog-alive guard so a
  closed window cannot dereference deallocated state.
- File-open panel uses `setAllowedContentTypes_` with UTType when available,
  falling back to `setAllowedFileTypes_`; WOFF/WOFF2 sources are now accepted.
- ScrollView document view is set via `_nsObject.setDocumentView_`, and the
  inner Group is sized with an explicit width so checkboxes render visibly.
- `compute_hull` now anchors the AxisTriple default to a numeric value in
  range (current fontTools rejects `None`).
- Default-clamp warning now uses `isinstance(constraint, instancer.AxisTriple)`
  with a 3-value unpack — the original 2-value unpack always raised.
- `produce_restricted_vf` filters `fvar.instances`, prunes STAT AxisValues
  outside the new hull, and sets `partial.flavor = 'woff'|'woff2'` so WOFF
  outputs are actually WOFF-wrapped (instead of mislabelled sfnt bytes).
- `patch_name_table` strips non-English localised records for IDs it rewrites,
  pairs nameID 17 with nameID 16, drops unencodable mac_roman records (no more
  literal `?` chars), and respects PostScript spec length caps for IDs 6/25.
- `sanitize_filename` (new) strips control characters, Unicode directional
  overrides, and trailing dots/spaces in addition to Windows-reserved chars.
- `safe_output_path` (new) resolves the output path and refuses anything that
  would escape the chosen folder; auto-suffixes on file-name collision.
- Status label is now multi-line and selectable; absolute paths shown to the
  user are scrubbed to `~`-relative form.
- Worker thread catches specific exceptions and logs full tracebacks to the
  Macro Panel via `traceback.print_exc()`.
- Dialog switched from `vanilla.FloatingWindow` to `vanilla.Window` so it does
  not float over Finder windows.
- UI pixel constants moved off the module top-level onto `VFClampDialog`.
- Status prefix is text-only (`Error:`) instead of an emoji that can render as
  `.notdef` on older macOS.

### Fixed

- TTFont handles are now opened inside `contextlib.closing()` so file
  descriptors are released promptly in long-lived Glyphs sessions.
- File-size cap (64 MB) on input fonts to guard against crafted/oversized
  inputs.
- fontTools version is asserted on import (>= 4.34.0).

### Removed

- Unused `import warnings` and the duplicated `compact_name` implementation
  inside `plugin.py` (now lives in `core.py` only).
